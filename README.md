## Project Description
The Elevator Control System project is designed to simulate the operation of a real-life elevator system. The system includes multiple elevators that move up and down between floors, and a control system that manages the movement of the elevators. The project is implemented using object-oriented design and programming principles, and the UML diagrams provide a detailed description of the system's architecture and functionality.



## UML Diagrams
The PDF document in this repository includes the following UML diagrams:

1. Use Case Diagram

2. Class Case Diagram

3. Sequence Diagram

4. Collaboration Diagram

5. Activity Diagram

6. Statechart Diagram

7. Package Diagram

8. Component Diagram

9. Deployment Diagram

Each diagram provides a unique perspective on the design and implementation of the Elevator Control System, and together they provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's functionality.
