## Project Description
The Alumni Information System UML project is a visual representation of an information system that manages the data of an educational institution's alumni. The project uses UML diagrams to describe the system's architecture and functionality. The system is designed to allow the institution to keep track of its alumni's information such as their personal information, educational background, and employment details. The UML diagrams provide a detailed representation of the system's components, such as classes, objects, and their relationships, and illustrate the flow of data and control within the system. The project's design emphasizes modularity and scalability to accommodate the changing needs of the institution and its growing alumni network.



## UML Diagrams
The PDF document in this repository includes the following UML diagrams:

1. Use Case Diagram

2. Class Case Diagram

3. Sequence Diagram

4. Collaboration Diagram

5. Activity Diagram

6. Statechart Diagram

7. Package Diagram

8. Component Diagram

9. Deployment Diagram

Each diagram provides a unique perspective on the design and implementation of the Elevator Control System, and together they provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's functionality.
